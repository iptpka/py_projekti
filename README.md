# SVG Creator - Creating Lines with Splines

[![Github Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/iptpka/py_projekti?logo=github&style=for-the-badge&labelColor=333333)](https://github.com/iptpka/py_projekti/releases)

**This SVG Creator / spline application is a project we decided to create for our OOP (Object Oriented Programming) 2023 course in Turku UAS.**

* **Why splines?:** Because we both had an interest towards SVG creation and generation, and we wanted to see how difficult it would be to create your very own SVGs from scratch... Literally.
* **Technologies:** The SVG Creator is made by using Python and the pygame library.
